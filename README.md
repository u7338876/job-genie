## Introduction

Welcome to Job Genie! I'd like to start with the cavaet that I am a Year 2 Computing student (as of 2023) and I started this simple project as part of my internship. The data and logic used in this project does not reflect the HR systems used in my organisation. 

The dashboard makes use of Dash and Plotly for visualisation, while Pandas is used for data analysis. 

## Installation Instructions

1. To start the dashboard, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I used Jupyter Notebook to develop my code. For that, you will need to download Anaconda Navigator. Click [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/install/) for the installation instructions. 

2. Next, you will need to download and import the required packages. Instructions are in the [notebook](V2_CareerPathsApp.ipynb). 

3. Then, simply run the cells in the notebook. At the final cell, you should see a link after running the cell. Click on the link to open the dashboard.
